# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
6.12.2022: UC Davis; Week 1: Excel Project
Intent of the project was to identify successful Kickstarter campaigns as a new project that is being proposed is a $12,000 theater-play event. The analysis of kickstarter campaigns focused on previous theater events in the U.S., particulalry how many were successful and what was their initial goal vs. what was pledged. The data for this analysis was provided by UC-Davis and occurs between 2009 and 2017. Findings include
  1. Theater events in the U.S. reach their target goal on kickstarter  57.5% of the time
  2. Plays in the U.S. reach their targe goal 61.4% of the time
  3. The time of year that successful campaigns occur is late spring, early summer -- April thru July (62.8%, 66.9%, 65.4%, 63.0%) 
  4. This late spring-early summer period also has a higher volume of campaigns (113, 116, 153, 138) with the yearly average by month being 116.
  5. The 5 plays that most are most similar in scope to the one being proposed asked for an average of 2100 GBP (range 1000-4000 GBP) with a successful pledge amount being 2384 GBP (range 1168-4137 GBP). However these were based in Great Briton
  6.  In the U.S. theater events were successful when asking for a median of $3000 that recieved a median pledge of $3168. 
  7.  Theater events that failed asked for a median of $5,000, only recieving a median pledge amount of $103.

Discussion:
From the analysis conducted, the recommendation for a theatrical play Kickstarter campaign, to be successful, is to conduct it between April and July. It would also behoove the host of the proposed campaign to ask for a donation amount in the range of $2500 - $3000. The reason for this is the $2500 amount is what similar plays suceeded on in Great Britain (once the currency was converted from Pounds Sterling to Dollars) and the $3000 was the median of what succeded in the U.S. The trend towards a failing campaign occurs quickly in the distribution as failing campaigns asked for a median of $5000. Hence, a proposed theatrical play with a budget of 12,000 should not try to obtain all of this through Kickstarter. Future Kickstarter campaigns with the theater-play art form and a budget of 12,000 should only expect to obtain about 20-25% of their budget through Kickstarter.   

If a deeper analysis was to be conducted identify donation amounts and number of donors is a good place to start. This is because if a grass-roots advertising campaign was to be used in concert with the Kickstarter campaign it would identify the expected amount of money provided by a donor. Should the Kickstarter campaign manager try to get several big donations or many small donations to achieve the financial goal. Based on this, the manager would have an idea of what events to go to to generate support and fincial backing for the proposed theatrical play.
